            What you'll be creating here is a swap request. The assets are not

            Specify the party ID of the recipient. For this example, we can use
            the Party ID of the default counterparty, so click{" "}

            out, the asset type you want to receive, and the quantity. Perhaps
            you believe your asset is worth 1 ExampleToken, or 100
            ExampleTokens.

          <Typography>
            If later you want to change the swap terms, you will need to cancel
            the swap proposal and create a new one with the new terms.
